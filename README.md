## Foodstuff Ordering app
### This is a website built to order foodstuff in Nigeria. It hopes to help folks in lessening the everday stress that comes from the haggling in the markeplace for foodstuff. The project was started on the 2nd of November and ended on the 16th of November, 2023.
### This project was created to help people shop for foodstuff without the torturous process involved in the Nigerian market. The Nigerian market can be considered a warzone where one has to haggle intensely over the price of every product before one can find a mostly fair price for their goods. While this can add to the normal Nigerian fun once in a while; it is no doubt extremely stressful to have to do this constantly especially with the recent increase in workload of all stations across the country which has led to less time to dedicate to oneself, the state of the economy which leaves one without even enough energy to talk to others and even the general lack of interest in leaving the comfort of our homes. This project aims to help in securing the best prices for foodstuff that can be gotten from the comfort of our homes.
#### Features completed:
- Add to cart functionality: This enables the user to add as much items to their cart as needed while also keeping track of the total amount of items added.
- Cart viewing functionality: this enables users to view objects in their cart and add or remove items or number of items as needed.
- Checkout functionality: this takes the user to the checkout page to input their details to know where the products are to be shipped.
#### Most difficult technical challenge:
- This would be the deployment aspect. I had issues first with the requirements.txt file which couldnâ€™t be installed no matter what i tried which led to me carefully formatting parts of the file. I had issues with the static files while running collectstatic which led to having to set up new static root for deployment. i had issues with the media files which led to me having to set up new media root. I had to do all this in a different virtual environment on the deployment site than the the one i had set previously. The only issue left now is to sort the About page which should be resolved soon.
#### Usage: The user has the option to log in or buy as a guest user. The user selects the goods wanted; then proceeds to the the cart to remove or add to the quantity of goods needed. The user then proceeds to checkout where a new logged in user and the guest user has to input their names and emails to the input fields provided. A known user skips this point and they all proceed to input address, city, state and country. Once this is done, the user proceeds to payment with a third party service
